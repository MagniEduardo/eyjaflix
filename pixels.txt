How many pixels are there in a centimeter?
Assuming the pixel density is 96 dpi, there are 96 pixels per inch. We know that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm. So there are 96 pixels per 2.54 cm. Than 1 centimeter = (96 / 2.54) px. Therefore, there are 38 pixels in one centimeter.

How to calculate centimeter to pixel
dpi is the pixel density or dots per inch.
96 dpi means there are 96 pixels per inch.
1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters.

1 inch = 2.54 cm
dpi = 96 px / in
96 px / 2.54 cm

Therefore one centimeter is equal to
1 cm = 96 px / 2.54
1 cm = 37.79527559055118 px

If we round the pixel value, we get
1 cm = 38 px for 96 dpi.
